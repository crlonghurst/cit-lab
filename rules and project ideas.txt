The rules of the CIT Drop in Lab project.

1. Code you add please add comments including what the code does and who wrote it and when.
2. Push to your branch and not the master, because that will cause lots of problems.
3. Please have CamelCase variable names or camelCase variable and function names.
4. Git commit's please have a good commit message.
